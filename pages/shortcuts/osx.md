# Essential OS X keyboard shortcuts 1

A humble disclaimer: this list is not intended to include all OS X keyboard shortcuts, or be a cheat sheet for wide audience. I sought to keep it as short as possible to reduce the noise, so I've included only actually useful hotkeys, that are new for me as a Windows user switched to Mac.

For example, this compillation includes `Command-Shift-G` shortcut helping to go to specific directory in Finder or Open file dialog. But you won't find here `Command-S` common key combination to save current document, because it is obvious after `Ctrl-S` on Windows or Linux.

Actual for OS X 10.9.

## Finder

- `Command-Down` — Go into selected folder or open the selected file. Space bar or Enter are not working this way, which be unexpected to Windows users.
- `Command-Up` — Go to parent folder.
- `Space` — Open selected file in Quick view.
- `Command-Brackets` — Move backward/forward respectively to `[` and `]` bracket.
- `Command-Option-V` — Move copied file.
- `Commanf-Shift-G` — Go to directory. This shortcut allows to directly type required path. Works in Open/Save file dialogs.
- `Command-Delete` — Move selected file to trash.
- `Command-Option-Delete` — Delete file bypassing trash.
- `Command-Shift-Delete` — Empty trash. Add `Shift` to evade prompt.

## Screenshots

- `Command-Shift-3` — Capture entire screen.
- `Command-Shift-4` — Capture screen section. While dragging: hold Spacebar to move selected area; hold Shift to change size in one direction; hold Option for center-based resizing.
- `Command-Shift-4` + `Space` — Capture a window.

## Chrome

- `Command-Shift-Delete` — Clear browsing data (with prompt).
- `Command-Y` — Open History.
- `Command-Shift-J` — Downloads (who would have guessed!).

## Shutting down

- `Command-Option-Ctrl-Eject` — Shutdown w/o confirmation.
- `Command-Ctrl-Eject` — Restart w/o confirmation.
- `Command-Option-Eject` — Sleep w/o confirmation.
- `Ctrl-Eject` — Show Dialog with Restart, Sleep & Shutdown Options.
- `Ctrl-Shift-Eject` — Put display to sleep.

## Other

- `Command-Option-Escape` — Force Application Quit dialog.
- `Command-Option-Shift-Escape` — Force quit frontmost application.
- Hold `Shift` while changing system volume to avoid confirmation beeps.
- `Command-Tilde` — Switch between windows of the same application.
